Custom scheduler - load shortest first

i) Algorithm description:
1: select process with shortest job-time
2: run selected process until job is complete
3: repeat


ii) Strong scenarios:
- situations where the number of processes completed is the most important metric.
- situations where there are many low job-time processes and a handful of high job-time processes.

iii) Weak scenarios:
- situations where processes need to be executed and completed soon after being launched (this algo can cause starvation if small processes keep launching).
